🛠️ Final Suggestion
If the error message says something like “Compile error: Expected: expression” or “Syntax error”, and it’s pointing to the array, try this:
1. 	Comment out the array and replace it with a simple one:

2. 	Run the macro. If it works, the issue is likely a hidden character in your original array block.

If you can tell me the exact error message you're getting and which line it highlights, I’ll be able to give you a laser-focused fix. You're super close—let’s get this wrapped up.
